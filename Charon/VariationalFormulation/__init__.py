CharonX Variational Formulation Module
======================================

This module provides the core framework for defining variational formulations 
of mechanical problems using the finite element method with FEniCSx.

The module implements a set of tools to define mechanical problems
in various dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) with support for different coordinate systems,
constitutive laws, boundary conditions, and multiphase materials.
